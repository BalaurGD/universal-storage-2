// situationMask - uses the sum of the situation bits to determine where the experiment can be conducted:
// SrfLanded = 1,
// SrfSplashed = 2,
// FlyingLow = 4,
// FlyingHigh = 8,
// InSpaceLow = 16,
// InSpaceHigh = 32


//biomeMask	- uses the same pattern as situationMask to determine whether experiment will give different result for different biomes. i.e. 7 = 1 + 2 + 4 so flying high will have only a single result per body but flying low (and landed or splashed) will give one result per biome
