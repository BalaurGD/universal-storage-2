			Carbon dioxide waste storage, built in a wedge format to be mounted to Universal Storage cores.  CO2 is stored compressed and this wedge contains the compression equipment and safety systems.  The bottle may be refueled via lines, or the entire wedge can be removed on EVA and placed with new equipment or storage.  Four size variants are available.
