//Description	

	category = Utility
	description = Designed to fit within wedge mounting bays, these extendable tanks lack a bulky external structure, and are consequently delicate with a low dry mass. Contains pressurized cryogenic hydrogen suited for powering fuel cells, or generating water with a little black magic.
