		description = This complex electrolyzer splits water into oxygen and hydrogen with large amounts of electricity. Featuring a chassis originally built for high pressure fumigation equipment, the Elektron has proven itself apt at both sustaining and destroying little green crawling things. Outputs 800 litres of oxygen per litre of input water.
