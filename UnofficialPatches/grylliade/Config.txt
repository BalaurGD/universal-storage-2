A couple of errors in config files I’ve noticed (for the 1.9.1 beta, if it makes a difference):

Control/ACDMedium.cfg: missing a closing brace for ModuleTestSubject.
Electrical/GuidanceComputer.cfg: has a “//-” instead of “/-” on line 147; basically acts like a missing closing brace.
Lifesupport/WaterWedge.cfg: Two EXTRA closing braces after the TAC Life Support section.
Processors/WaterPurifier.cfg: Missing closing brace after the USI Life Support section.
Radials/RadialTanks.cfg: “/0/category” instead of “//category” under Kerbalism section; also, “techRequired” and “cost” aren’t commented out (shouldn’t break anything AFAICT, but should still be fixed). Probably wouldn’t be a bad idea to fix the “VariantColors” to “@VariantColors” in the edits, either.
