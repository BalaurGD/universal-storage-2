, I don't know if this mod is still alive, but I found a tiny little bug in a config file. In the TAC LS section of ComboLifeSupportWedge.cfg, there's the following resource definition:

RESOURCE
{
name = Water
amount = 60
maxAmount = 60
}
It should be:

@RESOURCE[Water]
{
@name = Water
@amount = 60
@maxAmount = 60
}
